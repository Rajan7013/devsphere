geometric sans-serif. Color: deep blue #1854b4 on white background.

## Logo Prompt 3: Abstract Tech Symbol

**Best for:** Memorable brand mark, scalable identity

Circular format, balanced composition.
```

## Logo Prompt 6: Isometric Tech Icon

**Best for:** Modern tech aesthetic, distinctive identity

```
Design a minimal isometric logo icon representing web and mobile development. 
The icon should show layered platforms or stacked geometric shapes in an 
isometric view, suggesting multi-platform development. Use clean lines, 
precise angles (30-60-90 degrees), and a single accent color (pink #f021b2). 
Style: flat isometric, no gradients, geometric precision, minimal. 
The icon should be simple enough to work as an app icon or favicon. 
White background, square format (1:1).
```

## Logo Prompt 7: Negative Space Design

**Best for:** Clever, memorable branding

```
Create a clever negative space logo for a digital agency. The positive 
space should form a geometric shape (like a hexagon or diamond), while 
the negative space reveals code brackets < > or a forward slash /. 
Color: single vibrant color (red #ec1839) on white background. 
Style: ultra-minimal, geometric, smart use of positive/negative space. 
The design should be instantly recognizable and work at any size. 
Vector-style, flat design, no effects.

designed to work with any accent color overlay. Style: Swiss design, 
minimal, architectural, timeless. The logo should feel confident and
